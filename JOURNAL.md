## 1/24/2026 7 PM - Completed Schematic   

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

So i looked at a few circuits online and designed a circuit referencing them and added some parts which i already had with me and made the schematic.

the basic working principle is that the circuit will be powered using a 15-0-15 transformer and will have a LM317T regulator ic to adjust the cutoff voltage. and when the cutoff voltage will be reached the circuit will turn off automatically via a relay.

## 1/24/2026 9 PM - Completed the PCB   

_Time spent: 2.0h_  

Completed routing the PCB and finding the components required most of it were that i alr have with me just needed to add a few more things.

also learned to use the easy eda to kicad tool its amazing so useful for ppl who source there parts from lcsc very handy

## 1/25/2026 - modified a few things  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

modified the pcb a bit just changed the placement of a of a few parts and researched the parts that i need for the board. the 2 trimpot need will used to set the cutoff and on voltage for the board
